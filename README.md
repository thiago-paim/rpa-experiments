# rpa-experiments

This repository contains multiple experiments on building Python RPA scripts using different packages for comparison. The scripts are split into folders according to the used tool.

The scripts are written with an Windows OS in mind (though some might also work in other OS's).


### Activate virtualenv on Windows
```.\venv\Scripts\activate```
